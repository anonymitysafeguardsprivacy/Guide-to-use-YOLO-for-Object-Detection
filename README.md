#### _Learn how to run and train YOLO models for Object-Detection with the step-by-step guides in this repository._

---

**YOLO** (_You Only Look Once_) is a real-time object detection system known for its speed and efficiency.\
Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing objects within an image or video.

This repository provides resources to help you:

**_Perform Inference with a YOLO Model_ :**\
This involves using a pre-trained YOLO model to detect objects in new, unseen images or videos.\
The model processes the input and generates bounding boxes around detected objects and identifying them along with confidence scores indicating the accuracy of detections.

**_Training a YOLO Model_ :**\
This involves fine-tuning or training a YOLO model on a custom dataset.\
This process allows the model to learn to detect new objects of interest that may not be present in the original pre-trained model.\
Training requires a labeled dataset consisting of images and corresponding annotations/labels that specify the location and class of each object.
