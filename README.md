### Guide to use YOLO for Object-Detection


#### _Learn how to run and train YOLO models for Object-Detection with the step-by-step guides in this repository._

---

**YOLO** (_You Only Look Once_) is a real-time object detection system known for its speed and efficiency.\
Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and localizing objects within an image or video.

**_Learn basic features of Google Colab_ :**\
This tutorial will walk you through the basic features of Google Colab and show you how to get started with using them..

**_Perform Inference with a YOLO Model_ :**\
This involves using a pre-trained (already available) YOLO model to detect objects in new, unseen images or videos.

**_Train a YOLO Model_ :**\
This process allows the model to learn to detect new objects of interest that a pre-trained model is incapable of detecting.
